Galahad Framework Extension
===========================

The Galahad Framework Extension is a library of code that extends the Zend Framework.  Some of the projects in here will eventually be proposed to the Zend Framework (and migrated there if accepted), some will not (the Modelling architecture, for example, because Zend has stated many times that there won't be a Zend_Model class).

Main Components
---------------

Galahad FE has the following packages:

 - Galahad_Model
 - Galahad_Tool
 - Galahad_View

### Galahad_Model

Provides basic functionality to facilitate modeling.

### Galahad_Tool

Provides extensions to Zend_Tool to generate Galahad resources (most notably Models).

### Galahad_View

Currently only contains one view helper for common functionality.  More to come.
